# CD-HIT Cluster file Parser
CD-HIT (http://weizhong-lab.ucsd.edu/cd-hit/) is a powerful tool to significantly reduce the computational and manual efforts in many sequence analysis tasks, understanding the data structure and correct the bias within a dataset.

**cdhitparser.py** takes a cluster file (.clstr) as input and returns a .json file and csv file with the cluster number as key and all the clustered sequence ids as values.

`>python cdhitparser.py -c clusterfile.clstr -v`
